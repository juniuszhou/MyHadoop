####
hbase must cooperate with zookeeper.

each server need register to /hbase/src in znode.



## data storage format
HFile key value format. it is binary in HDFS. StoreFile just a wrapper on HFile.
HLogFile write ahead log for HBase.

root table and metadata table.

## HRegion
a table includes a lot of HRegions. just one at the beginning.
then be more regions if more and more data.

HRegion include several store, store just for one columns family.

store has one memStore and several StoreFile.
StoreFile 's format is HFile and exist in HDFS.


## Interface
shell, REST gateway. Thrift gateway. support java/scala, c/c++, python.



## core algorithm
LSM log structured merge tree used by HBase.

for oracle, mysql use btree.

LSM much faster for write
btree faster for read.

LSM put data into a lot of ordered block.
Bloom filter used to determine if a sorted block include the data.
